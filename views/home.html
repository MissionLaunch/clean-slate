                <h1>You Can Succeed WITH a Criminal History Record</h1>
                <p>You may be able to seal your criminal record. When a DC criminal record is sealed, the government deletes or limits access to it. A sealed record can generally not be used against you if are applying for a job, in other background checks or in certain legal proceedings. A lawyer can help determine if you are eligible.                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website can help you decide if you want to seal your record and, if you do, connect you with a lawyer who can help.
