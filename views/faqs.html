                If a DC criminal record is sealed, the government deletes or limits access to it. A sealed record can generally not be used against you on job applications, in other background checks, or in certain legal proceedings. Even after your DC criminal record is sealed, there are certain agencies and employers that CAN still see your record.</p>

            A lawyer can look at your entire criminal history record and determine what specific arrests or convictions can be sealed. If it turns out that you are eligible to seal part of your criminal history record, a lawyer can also help you draft a motion, which is a letter to the court requesting them to seal part of your criminal history. Even if they can’t write the entire motion for you, they can review it before you submit it to the court.</p>
